Analyze Global Natural Disaster Patterns: Examine historical disaster data (wildfires, floods, storms, etc.) to understand trends over time, geographic hotspots, and the frequency of events.

Predict Disaster Occurrences or Severity: Build a predictive model that can estimate:

The type/category of a disaster based on location, time, and other features (classification), or

The severity/impact of a disaster, such as number of affected people or economic damage (regression).

Support Decision-Making for Disaster Response: Use insights and predictions to help governments, NGOs, and emergency response teams prioritize resources, plan evacuations, and reduce human and economic losses.

Visualize Trends and Insights: Create interactive dashboards (in Tableau Public) showing:

Disaster frequency over years and months

Geographic distribution of disasters on maps

Category-wise distribution (e.g., wildfires vs. storms)

Key metrics (total disasters, affected population, etc.)

Demonstrate Data Handling Skills: Showcase handling of missing data, feature engineering, temporal and spatial analysis, and integration of AI models with visualizations.
